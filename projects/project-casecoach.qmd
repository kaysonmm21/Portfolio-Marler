## Overview

CaseCoachAI is an AI-powered consulting case interview trainer that lets candidates practice structuring and delivering frameworks out loud — on demand, without a practice partner. The app records audio responses, transcribes them, and evaluates them across a 20-point rubric using AI, tracking score improvement across sessions.

Most case prep tools rely on static frameworks or human practice partners that are hard to schedule and inconsistent to evaluate. CaseCoachAI provides rubric-anchored AI scoring tied to the exact dimensions MBB interviewers assess — including structural quality, hypothesis prioritization, and strategic fit. When a candidate scores below threshold on their weakest dimension, the app surfaces a targeted hypothesis drill for focused remediation rather than full re-practice.

**Key capabilities:**

- Record and transcribe audio case responses in real time
- AI evaluation across a 20-point rubric aligned to MBB interview standards
- Session-to-session score tracking to surface improvement trends
- Targeted hypothesis drills triggered by underperformance on specific dimensions
