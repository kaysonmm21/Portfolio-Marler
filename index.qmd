I'm a strategic management student at Brigham Young University's Marriott School of Business, pursuing the consulting track with a focus on structured problem-solving, data-driven decision-making, and leadership. I maintain a 4.00 GPA and have been recognized as a U.S. Presidential Scholar and Wheatley Scholar.

My experience reflects a strong interest in consulting-style work. I've supported investment and operational decisions at Leavitt Equity Partners by building financial models, conducting competitive analyses, and creating executive dashboards for a $200M+ fund. I also have served as a teaching assistant for Kim B. Clark, former Dean of Harvard Business School, where I helped students develop clearer leadership intuition through case-based leadership analysis.

This summer, I will be joining Cicero Group as an Analyst Intern, where I'm excited to deepen my experience in strategy consulting and client-facing problem-solving. Following this internship, I plan to pursue a full-time career in consulting.

Beyond coursework and internships, I enjoy building systems that make people more effective—whether through entrepreneurship, leadership training, or exploring how technology and AI can support better preparation and performance. I'm motivated by complex problems, rapid learning, and turning ambiguity into clear, actionable insights.
